    BatchedMctsUtilities

This module provides utility structures and functions designed to facilitate the
implementation of batched Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms, specifically targeted
for AlphaZero and Gumbel MCTS variants. It's designed for compatibility with both CPU and
GPU backends, leveraging batch operations to improve parallelism and performance.

## Main Components:

- `EnvOracle`: A struct that serves as an abstraction layer to encapsulate environment
   dynamics for MCTS. It contains two main fields, the `init_fn` and `transition_fn`
   functions, which are responsible for environment initialization and state transitions,
   respectively.

- `GumbelMctsConfig` and `AlphaZeroMctsConfig`: Structs that define configurations for
   running MCTS based on either the Gumbel or AlphaZero algorithm. These structs specify
   parameters like the number of simulations to run, exploration parameters, and device
   preferences.

- `get_valid_actions`: A function that returns an array denoting the valid actions for
   each environment in a batch.

# # Environment Oracle

"""
    EnvOracle{I <: Function, T <: Function}(; init_fn, transition_fn)

The `EnvOracle` struct serves as an abstraction layer that encapsulates environment
dynamics for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) procedures. It is specifically engineered to
facilitate batch operations conducive for parallel computations across multiple
computational units, such as GPUs and CPUs.

## Fields

- `init_fn::I`: Function for environment initialization.
- `transition_fn::T`: Function for state transition given actions.

### init_fn

The `init_fn` function receives an array of environment objects and returns a
NamedTuple with the following fields:

- `internal_states`: An array-like data structure that encapsulates the internal state
   representation, optimized for the MCTS algorithm and compatible with the `transition_fn`.
   For AlphaZero it should be the environments themselves, for MuZero it can be state
   representations.
- `valid_actions`: A Boolean array with dimensions `(num_actions, num_envs)`, denoting the
   admissibility of actions in each state.
- `logit_prior`: An `AbstractArray{Float32,2}` with dimensions `(num_actions, num_envs)`.
   Represents the unnormalized logarithm of action probabilities.
- `policy_prior`: A probability array with dimensions `(num_actions, num_envs)`, denoting
   the prior belief over actions.
- `value_prior`: An `AbstractVector{Float32}` containing prior values for states with
   dimensions `(num_envs,)`. In most environments, it's advised to constrain the values
   within `[-1, 1]`.

### transition_fn

The `transition_fn` function takes an array of internal states and an array of action
identifiers as inputs and returns a NamedTuple consisting of:

- `internal_states`: New environments (AlphaZero) or updated state representations (MuZero).
- `rewards`: An array of `Float32` indicating the immediate rewards resultant from the
   transitions. Dimensions: `(num_envs,)`.
- `terminal`: A Boolean array signifying whether the resultant states are terminal.
   Dimensions: `(num_envs,)`.
- `player_switched`: A Boolean array indicating if the player has changed during the
   transition. Dimensions: `(num_envs,)`.
- `valid_actions`, `logit_prior`, `policy_prior`, `value_prior`: Similar to `init_fn`,
   with the difference that these fields are now computed for the new states. Note that
   these values will be disregarded if the new states are terminal states.

### Constraints

- All arrays must be of type `isbits` to ensure GPU compatibility.
- Last dimension of all arrays should correspond to the batch dimension `(num_envs)`.

## Constraints on Computational Backends

- Depending on the device specified in the `MctsConfig`, `init_fn` and `transition_fn` can
  receive either a CPU-based array (`Array`) or a GPU-based array (`CuArray`).

## Examples of Internal State Encodings

- In AlphaZero the `internal_states` field should be the of the same type as the `envs`
  argument. That is, a batch of environments structures.
- In MuZero, the `internal_states` field should be of the type `AbstractArray{Float32, N}`,
  where the first (N-1) dimensions represent the latent state, and the last dimension
  corresponds to the batch dimension `(num_envs)`.
