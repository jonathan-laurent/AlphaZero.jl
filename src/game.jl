"""
A generic interface for single-player games and two-player zero-sum games.

Stochastic games and intermediate rewards are supported. By convention,
rewards are expressed from the point of view of the player called _white_.
In two-player zero-sum games, we call `black` the player trying to minimize the reward.

##### Game environments and game specifications

# NAMING CONVENTION:
# - A game specification is usually written: `game_spec` or `gspec`.
# - A game environment is usually written: `game` or `g`.
#   We usually avoid `env` as it is too generic and can clash with the name for an
#   MCTS environment or training environment.
# - A state is usually written: `state` or `s`.
# - An action is usually written: `action` or `a`.

    AbstractGameSpec

Abstract type for a game specification.

The specification holds all _static_ information about a game, which does not
depend on the current state.

    AbstractGameEnv

Abstract base type for a game environment.

Intuitively, a game environment holds a game specification and a current state.

Create a new game environment in a (possibly random) initial state.

Return the game specification of an environment.

Return whether or not a game is a two-players game.

Return a vectorized representation of a given state.

"""
    set_state!(game::AbstractGameEnv, state)

Modify the state of a game environment in place.

Return `true` if white is to play and `false` otherwise.

For a one-player game, this function must always return `true`.

    actions_mask(::AbstractGameEnv)

Return a boolean mask indicating what actions are available.

Update the game environment by making the current player perform `action`.
Note that this function does not have to be deterministic.

Return the intermediate reward obtained by the white player after the last
transition step. The result is undetermined when called at an initial state.

Return a heuristic estimate of the state value for the current player.

This function is not needed by AlphaZero but it is useful for building
baselines such as minmax players.

     size `num_actions(game)`.

A default implementation is provided that returns an empty vector.

In the game of tic-tac-toe, there are eight symmetries that can be
obtained by composing reflexions and rotations of the board (including the
